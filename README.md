# Data_Science_Portfolio

This respository consist of Machine learning data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Python Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs) and report giving overview of the project.

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.*

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/Ntaralkar/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Boston_Housing_Analysis/Boston_housing_analysis.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	- [Supervised Learning: Graduate Admissions (Regression & Classification)](https://github.com/Ntaralkar/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Graduate_Admissions/Graduate%20Admission.ipynb): Built different supervised machine learning models demostrating the parameters that are important during the application for Masters Programs. Regression models to predict the chances of candidates for a particular university.
	


- ### Natural Language Processing
	- [Generate Sparse representations using tokenization](https://github.com/Ntaralkar/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/Sentiment%20Analysis):The aim of this task is to build sparse representations for the meeting transcripts generated in task 1, which includes word tokenization, vocabulary generation, and the generation of sparse representations.


- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- __Python__
	
		- [Melbourne Housing](https://github.com/Ntaralkar/Melbourne-Housing/blob/master/Housing%20Analysis.ipynb): BUilt supervised machine learning models to demonstrate which suburbs are best to live in and exploratory analysis that shows various factors that influence your decision of buying a house.
				
		
		
	- __R__
		- [Recruit Holdings- Shiny R application](https://github.com/Ntaralkar/Restaurant-Analysis): This shiny application shows data analysis for Recruitment Holdings company. The Shiny app allows user can view customers and stores in the application and navigate numbers in total level, at store level and region level.
		
		- [Machine learning Regression models](https://github.com/Ntaralkar/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Regression_models_in_R/FIT5197_Assignment2_Report.pdf): Used machine learning alogirthm to predict miles per gallon, income and perform sampling on the given datasets. The task was to impute missing values, perform exploratory analysis and use regression models (Linear and Logistic regression) to predict the outcome.
